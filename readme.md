# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Prototype

This repository contains a basic prototype of a decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented using Node.js and Express. The DEX allows users to buy and sell assets (in this case, Ethereum and USDC) in a decentralized manner. It includes functionalities for adding liquidity, buying assets, and selling assets.

## Features

- **Add Liquidity:** Users can add liquidity to the exchange by providing assets (e.g., Ethereum and USDC).
- **Buy Assets:** Users can buy assets (e.g., Ethereum) from the exchange using USDC.
- **Sell Assets:** Users can sell assets (e.g., Ethereum) to the exchange in exchange for USDC.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
